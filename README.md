# Personal Website files

I pieced together these CSS and Javascript files through a lot of research on the Internet. I had never dealt with modals before, so it was a fun exercise in web coding; well, I enjoyed it, at least. It took awhile to get the opening of multiple modal files correct and allow an infinite amount to be created with both CSS and JS applied.

### main.css
The main file; it's not large, but it sets up the website to load properly. Given that the main site is contained in one file, this is important.

### main.js
Small file to control how the navigation links behave

### modal.css
Define how the modal buttons look on page

### modal.js
What happens to the modal and define how the visitor can exit the modal by selecting an 'X' to close or clicking outside the modal
